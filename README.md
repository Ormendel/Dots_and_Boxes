# SquareGame
The game's idea goes to 2 pupils who have learnt with me while I was a teenager.
They showed me how to play and how to efficiently block a rival's move.
## Simulation
[![Watch the video](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9a/Play-Dots-and-Boxes-Step-1.jpg/v4-460px-Play-Dots-and-Boxes-Step-1.jpg.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNPAKBJavY&ab_channel=JonathanNethercott)

## How to play?
  - Each player draws (connects) between 2 dots in a vertical or horizontal way, but **not** diagonally.
  - Each player has a strategy in order to maximize no. of squares at the end of the game.
  - Drawing the 4th wall of a box wins it, earning you a point. When you close a box you must move again.
  - Lines are drawn until all squares are claimed. The player with the most claimed squares wins!
  - Be careful not to create long chains of boxes for your opponents to claim
  - Think of creative ways to double cross your opponent, forcing them to give you the long chains!
## How to decide who wins?
  - The player with the most squares is the winner

Run this also for examples in a seperate terminal:

```bash
ruby -r glimmer-dsl-libui -e "require 'examples/meta_example'"
```
