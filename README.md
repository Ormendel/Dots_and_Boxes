# SquareGame
The game's idea goes to 2 pupils who have learnt with me while I was a teenager.
They showed me how to play and how to efficiently block a rival's move.
## Simulation
[![Watch the video](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9a/Play-Dots-and-Boxes-Step-1.jpg/v4-460px-Play-Dots-and-Boxes-Step-1.jpg.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLNPAKBJavY&ab_channel=JonathanNethercott)

## How to play?
  - Each player draws (connects) between 2 dots in a vertical or horizontal way, but not diagonally.
  - Each player has a strategy in order to maximize no. of squares at the end of the game.
## How to decide who wins?
### 1st version
  - One goal of the game is to tell the score of each player in every turn.
  - The player with the most squares has won.
### 2nd version
  - In the 2nd version, the player who makes the **first** square/rectangle wins the game
